- Add in grid
- Make sure grid looks nice and is responsive
- Add in redux

- Create opening page that people see when they've not logged in.
- Create sign in/sign up form, goals submit form and forgotten work form.

- Add backend inc auth
- Set up database with all things we want
- Get api routes working

- Turn data from API into nice D3 visualisations for Stats page

- Polish up styling
- Consider security on API. 3 login attempts? Throttling requests on server to prevent
brute force?
